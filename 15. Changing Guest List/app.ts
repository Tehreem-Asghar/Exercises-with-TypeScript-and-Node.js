//Exercise 15  Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
// • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
// • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

let Guestlist: string[] = ['Arham', 'Ayesha', 'Taha'];
// for(let i=0; i<Guestlist.length; i++){
//     console.log(`"Dear ${Guestlist[i]}," \t\t\n"you are invited to dinner"\n`);
// };


let absent_guess: string = '\"Arham';
console.log(absent_guess + "," + "\tis not coming.\"\n")


let new_guest: string = 'Sarim';
Guestlist[0] = new_guest;


for (let i = 0; i < Guestlist.length; i++) {
    console.log(`"Dear ${Guestlist[i]}," \t\t\n"you are invited to dinner"\n`)
}
